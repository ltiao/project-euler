In the outermost-loop below, `primes` will always be the list of all prime number strictly below $n$, i.e. it is equivalent to $P_n$. Note that if $n$ is odd and composite, then the largest prime below it is no greater than $n-2$, since $n-1$ is even. Since $\\max S_n = n - 2$ searching through $P_n$ is sufficient (i.e. if $n-2$ is prime, then $n-2 \\in P_n$.) The loop terminates when we encounter an $n$ with no witnesses."

    "Note that not only is this implementation space-efficient, it is also very time efficient, since we incrementally build our list of primes, composites and witnesses incrementally from bottom-up. If we hadn't augmented the implementation of the prime sieve, we would have had to use the prime sieve to obtain all odd composites, and perform a primality test on all elements of $S_n$, which would (usually) require a prime factorization algorithm, which in turn (usually) requires a prime sieve, not to mention the fact that there would be many overlapping subproblems, i.e. many $n < m$ such that $S_n \\cap S_m \\ne \\emptyset$, so we'd have to use dynamic programming, by, for example memoizing the primality testing function or some other optimization - just a whole mess of redundancies and inefficiencies that we happily avoided with this method :)"
